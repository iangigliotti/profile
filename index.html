              <h4>The Beatles</h4>
              <p>"The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became regarded as the foremost and most influential music band in history.[1] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the group were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.[2] They often incorporated classical elements, older pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, and later experimented with several musical styles ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As the members continued to draw influences from a variety of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical sophistication grew, and they were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements."</p>

              <h4>The Wall</h4>
              <p>"The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd. It was released as a double album on 30 November 1979 in the United Kingdom by Harvest Records and in the United States by Columbia Records. Bassist and songwriter Roger Waters conceived the album as a rock opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when he became so frustrated with the audience that he spat on them. Its story explores Pink, a jaded rockstar character that Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins with the loss of his father during the Second World War and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, symbolised by a wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea."</p>

              <h4>Back to the Future Part III<br>Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</h4>
              <p>"Back to the Future Part III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack to the film Back to the Future Part III, the third and final installment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It was released under Varèse Sarabande on May 29, 1990. It features most of the score by composer Alan Silvestri.

              <h4>Amélie</h4>
              <p>"Amélie (also known as Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain; French pronunciation: ​[lə fa.by.lø des.tɛ̃ d‿a.me.li puˈlɛ̃]; English: The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain) is a 2001 French romantic comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre. It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by Audrey Tautou, who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. The film was a co-production between companies in France and Germany. Taking in over $33 million in a limited theatrical release, it is to date the highest-grossing French-language film released in the United States, and one of the biggest international successes for a French movie.[3]"</p>
